/**
 * Host owner of the `authorization` Remote namespace: the RPC/stream bridge
 * that lets a browser configuration page run and answer `ctx.authorization`
 * flows for a Sign-in affordance. Mounted directly at the top level of a
 * composition — unlike `yga/deepseek-harness`'s fork, which nested this
 * class inside `@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-settings-controller`'s constructor, this
 * package owns no dependency on that package at all: `AuthorizationController`
 * only ever needed `ctx`, so nesting it there was an organizational choice,
 * not an architectural one — `@deepseek-ai/dsh-typert-loader` auto-discovers
 * any top-level Loader entry that exports `./typert`.
 *
 * `begin` resolves only once the whole attempt settles, which can take as
 * long as a human takes to click through a consent page, so its notices and
 * prompts never ride the RPC response. They instead ride `follow`, one stream
 * shared by every connected configuration page: `prompt-requested` replays as
 * a reconnect baseline for every prompt still pending, so any tab — not only
 * the one that called `begin` — can answer it through `respond`.
 * `authorization/settled` (declared by `@deepseek-ai/dsh-authorization`
 * itself) rides the ordinary Remote Event allowlist instead, since every
 * listener needs it and no answer is expected.
 *
